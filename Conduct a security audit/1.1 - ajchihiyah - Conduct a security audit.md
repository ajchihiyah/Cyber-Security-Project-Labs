# Controls and Compliance Assessment 

## Case Study

This is based on a fictional company:

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist. 

## Scenario
Botium Toys: Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report

### Scope 

The scope is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This means all assets need to be assessed alongside internal processes and procedures related to the implementation of controls and compliance best practices.

### Goals
Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to determine which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to  improve Botium Toys’ security posture.

### Current assets
Assets managed by the IT Department include: 
* On-premises equipment for in-office business needs
* Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.
* Storefront products available for retail sale on site and online; stored in the company’s adjoining warehouse
* Management of systems, software, and services: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory management
* Internet access
* Internal network
* Data retention and storage
* Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring 

## Business Observations

- **Data Access:** Currently, all Botium Toys employees have access to internally stored data and may be able to access cardholder data and customers’ PII/SPII.
- **Encryption:** Encryption is not currently used to ensure confidentiality of customers’ credit card information that is accepted, processed, transmitted, and stored locally in the company’s internal database.
- **Access Controls:** Access controls pertaining to least privilege and separation of duties have not been implemented.
- **Data Integrity:** The IT department has ensured availability and integrated controls to ensure data integrity.
- **Firewall:** The IT department has a firewall that blocks traffic based on an appropriately defined set of security rules.
- **Antivirus Software:** Antivirus software is installed and monitored regularly by the IT department.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** The IT department has not installed an intrusion detection system (IDS).
- **Disaster Recovery:** There are no disaster recovery plans currently in place, and the company does not have backups of critical data.
- **Breach Notification:** The IT department has established a plan to notify E.U. customers within 72 hours if there is a security breach. Additionally, privacy policies, procedures, and processes have been developed and are enforced among IT department members and other employees to properly document and maintain data.
- **Password Policy:** Although a password policy exists, its requirements are nominal and not in line with current minimum password complexity requirements (e.g., at least eight characters, a combination of letters and at least one number; special characters).
- **Password Management:** There is no centralized password management system that enforces the password policy’s minimum requirements, which sometimes affects productivity when employees/vendors submit a ticket to the IT department to recover or reset a password.
- **Legacy Systems:** While legacy systems are monitored and maintained, there is no regular schedule in place for these tasks and intervention methods are unclear.
- **Physical Security:** The store’s physical location, which includes Botium Toys’ main offices, storefront, and warehouse of products, has sufficient locks, up-to-date closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance, as well as functioning fire detection and prevention systems.

## Risk assessment

#### Risk description
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards. 

#### Control best practices
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to identify assets so they can appropriately manage them. Additionally, they will need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.


#### Additional comments
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium, because the IT department does not know which assets would be at risk. The risk to assets or fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all of the necessary controls in place and is not fully adhering to best practices related to compliance regulations that keep critical data private/secure.

## Compliance Checklist
Does Botium Toys currenly adhrere to this compliance best practice? 

* Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

| **Compliance Category**                                | **Best Practice**                                                           | **Currently in Place** | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** | Only authorized users have access to customers’ credit card information    | No                     | Currently, there are no specific controls in place to restrict access to customers’ credit card information. All employees with database access can view sensitive information, which poses a significant risk. Implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) would mitigate this risk.          |
| **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**            | E.U. customers’ data is kept private/secured                              | Yes                    | Botium Toys has implemented measures to ensure that E.U. customers’ data is kept private and secure. This aligns with GDPR’s emphasis on data protection and privacy, demonstrating the company’s commitment to safeguarding personal information.             Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** | Implement data encryption procedures for credit card data                  | No                     | The company has not implemented encryption for credit card data at any stage of the transaction process. This is a fundamental PCI DSS requirement that prevents unauthorized parties from intercepting and reading sensitive data. Immediate action is required to comply.                        |
| **System and Organizations Controls ** | User access policies are established                                      | No                     | User access policies are currently not established. This lack of defined access controls poses a risk of unauthorized data access and is not in compliance with SOC standards. It is crucial to implement and enforce user access policies to mitigate this risk.                               |


# Audit Recommendation for Botium Toys

After conducting the security audit, I’ve identified some areas that need immediate attention to strengthen Botium Toys’ security and compliance. Below are my recommendations as a junior security analyst:

## 1. Implement Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)
- **Issue:** Currently, everyone in the company has the same level of access, which isn’t secure.
- **Recommendation:** Set up different access levels for employees based on their job roles. This way, only people who need access to sensitive information, like customer credit card details, can view it. Regularly update these roles as people change positions or responsibilities.

## 2. Create and Test a Disaster Recovery Plan
- **Issue:** There’s no plan in place for what to do if a major IT failure or disaster happens.
- **Recommendation:** Develop a detailed plan for recovering from disasters, including regular backups of important data and clear steps to restore operations. Test the plan regularly to ensure it works and everyone knows their role.

## 3. Update Password Policies and Use a Password Manager
- **Issue:** Current password policies are not strong enough, and there is no centralized system to manage them.
- **Recommendation:** Strengthen password rules (e.g., requiring longer and more complex passwords) and use a password management tool to enforce these rules. This will reduce the risk of weak passwords being used.

## 4. Install an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- **Issue:** The company doesn’t have a system in place to detect malicious activities in the network.
- **Recommendation:** Set up an IDS to monitor the network for suspicious behavior. This will help in identifying and responding to attacks before they cause damage.

## 5. Encrypt Customer Data
- **Issue:** Sensitive data, such as credit card information, isn’t encrypted, making it vulnerable.
- **Recommendation:** Implement encryption for all sensitive data. This will ensure that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be read without the proper decryption key.


These recommendations are crucial for improving Botium Toys’ overall security and ensuring compliance with regulations. Prioritizing these actions will help protect the company from potential security incidents and data breaches. Regular follow-up audits should be conducted to monitor progress and make adjustments as needed.
