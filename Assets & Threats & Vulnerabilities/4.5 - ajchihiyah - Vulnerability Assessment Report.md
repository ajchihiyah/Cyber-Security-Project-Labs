# Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Scenario

As a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company, I have identified a critical vulnerability in the company’s database server. The server, which stores sensitive customer data, has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. This is a serious risk that needs to be addressed immediately. In this report, I will outline the risks associated with this open database and provide a remediation strategy to secure it and protect business operations.

### Date: 
**November 14, 2023 - January 14, 2024 (3 months)**

---

### System Description
The database server runs on a Debian Linux operating system and has 1TB of memory with a powerful CPU processor. The server hosts a MySQL database management system, providing the infrastructure for storing and retrieving customer, campaign, and analytic data. The server is configured with an IPv4 network connection and currently uses SSL for security, although TLS, the updated version, should be employed to ensure stronger encryption.

---

### Scope
This report focuses on the current access controls of the database server and its exposure to unauthorized users. The vulnerability assessment was conducted over a three-month period (November 14, 2023, to January 14, 2024), and the analysis adheres to the guidelines outlined in the [NIST SP 800-30](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/30/r1/final) framework for risk management.

---

### Purpose
The database contains large volumes of sensitive information, including customer data and marketing analytics that the company uses to track performance and personalize campaigns. To prevent unauthorized access or misuse of this data, securing the system is crucial. Failure to do so could result in data breaches, operational disruptions, and significant damage to the company's reputation.

### Risk Assessment

| Threat Source      | Threat Event                                          | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|:----------:|:--------:|:----:|
| Hackers            | Sensitive information is leaked to the public         |     3      |     3    |   9  |
| Former Employees   | Information is sold to competitors or leaked          |     2      |     3    |   6  |
| Current Employees  | Disruption of operational activities                  |     2      |     3    |   6  |
| Customers          | Unauthorized data modification                        |     1      |     3    |   3  |

- **Hackers**: The most significant risk is the exposure of sensitive customer data due to exfiltration. Publicly accessible databases can be targeted by hackers, potentially leading to data breaches that can severely damage the company’s reputation and result in financial losses.
- **Former Employees**: There is a moderate risk of former employees leaking or selling sensitive information to competitors, which could negatively impact the company’s competitiveness.
- **Current Employees**: Current employees may unintentionally or maliciously disrupt operational activities, affecting business continuity.
- **Customers**: There is a low risk of customers being able to alter stored data if the server remains publicly accessible.

### Approach
The risk of these events occurring was evaluated based on both the likelihood of the event happening and the severity of the impact it would have on the company’s operations. Unauthorized access to the database by hackers could lead to significant reputational and financial damage. While it is less likely, former employees could misuse their knowledge of the system. Current employees may unintentionally affect operations, and the possibility exists for customers to alter data, although this is considered a low risk.

### Remediation Strategy

1. **Restrict Public Access**: The database server should be made private, limiting access to authorized personnel only. This will help protect the confidentiality of sensitive information.

2. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Limit access to the database based on job roles to ensure that only users who need specific access to perform their duties can interact with sensitive data.

3. **Enhance Authentication and Authorization**: Introduce multi-factor authentication (MFA) using methods such as SMS codes, email verification, employee ID cards, or authentication apps. This will ensure that only authorized users can access the server.

4. **Encrypt Data Using TLS**: Transition from SSL to TLS for encryption. TLS is the more secure and updated protocol that will better protect the integrity of data transferred between the server and clients.

5. **Audit and Monitor Access**: Regular audits should be conducted to monitor access logs and detect any unauthorized or unusual activity. Implementing robust logging and alerting mechanisms will allow for quicker responses to potential threats.

By addressing the vulnerabilities outlined in this report, the company can significantly reduce its risk exposure, protect sensitive customer data, and maintain the integrity of its business operations. These changes are critical to safeguarding the organization from potential cyber threats.
