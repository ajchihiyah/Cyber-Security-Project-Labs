# Lab: Home Office Network Asset Classification
Objective:
In this lab, I will demonstrate how to classify assets connected to a home office network, an essential part of asset management and cybersecurity risk mitigation. The goal is to create an inventory of connected devices, identify key characteristics, and assign sensitivity levels to each asset.

# Scenario
I operate a small business from home and need to ensure that my network and devices are adequately protected. Asset management starts with creating an inventory of devices on my home network, classifying them based on their level of importance and sensitivity to potential risks. This lab shows the process of identifying, documenting, and classifying network devices.

### Step 1: Identify Assets
I began by identifying the key devices that are regularly connected to my home network. These devices include:

***- Personal Laptop***

***- Desktop***

***- HomePod***

***- Apple TV***

***- Router***

***- Wi-Fi***

***- Four External Hard Drives***

***- Smart TV***

### Step 2: Document Device Characteristics
Each device was documented with the following characteristics:

Network Access: How frequently the device connects to the network.
Owner: The individual responsible for the device.
Location: The physical location of the device within the home network setup.
Notes: Additional details about the device, such as what kind of data it stores and how critical it is to the security of the home network.

### Step 3: Asset Classification Table

I created the following asset inventory and assigned each device a sensitivity level based on how important it is to protect:

| **Asset**              | **Network Access** | **Owner**       | **Location**          | **Notes**                                                                                                   | **Sensitivity**   |
|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Personal Laptop**     | Frequent           | Homeowner       | Home office           | Contains work files, sensitive personal information, and financial data.                                     | Confidential      |
| **Desktop**             | Occasional         | Homeowner       | Home office           | Used for media consumption and personal projects. Contains personal photos.                                  | Restricted        |
| **HomePod**             | Continuous         | Homeowner       | Home office   | Voice assistant and speaker. Connected to the home network but holds no sensitive data.                       | Internal-only     |
| **Apple TV**            | Occasional         | Homeowner       | Home office          | Streams media and connects to other Apple devices. No sensitive data, but network integrity matters.          | Internal-only     |
| **Router**              | Continuous         | ISP/Homeowner   | Home office           | Central connection point for all network traffic. Controls access to all network devices.                     | Confidential      |
| **Wi-Fi**               | Continuous         | ISP/Homeowner   | Home office           | Provides internet access to all devices on the network. Security of this is critical for all connected assets.| Confidential      |
| **External Hard Drives**| Occasional         | Homeowner       | Home office           | Backup storage for personal and work files, including sensitive and confidential information.                 | Confidential      |
| **Smart TV**            | Occasional         | Homeowner       | Home office           | Streams media content, no sensitive data stored, but connects to the home network.                            | Internal-only     |

### Step 4: Classify Sensitivity Levels
Each device was classified based on the potential risk if the device's security was compromised:

Confidential: Devices that contain sensitive personal or work-related data, such as the Personal Laptop, Router, Wi-Fi, and External Hard Drives.

Restricted: Devices like the Desktop, which contain personal files but pose a lower risk than those classified as confidential.

Internal-only: Devices like the HomePod, Apple TV, and Smart TV that donâ€™t store sensitive data but are part of the network and could be used as entry points for attacks.

# Conclusion
By classifying the assets connected to my home network, I identified which devices require the most protection and which ones are less critical. This process is key to effective asset management and securing a home network. With this asset inventory, I can now implement stronger security controls for the most sensitive devices, such as encryption, backups, and limited access, to ensure they are protected from potential risks.
