# Incident Investigation: Payroll Breach
As the first cybersecurity professional hired by a growing business, I was tasked with investigating a recent payroll breach. The incident involved a mistaken deposit to an unknown bank account, which the business owner managed to stop before it was completed. My goal was to identify what went wrong and how we could prevent similar incidents in the future.

| The event occurred on 10/03/2023 at 8:29:57 AM, initiated by an administrator account (Legal\\Administrator). | The administrator account had excessive privileges, allowing access to payroll systems.          | Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit access based on job roles and responsibilities.  |
| The IP address associated with the action was 152.207.255.255, and the event source was related to payroll services (AdsmEmployeeService). | The account used was shared, making it difficult to trace the specific individual responsible.  | Introduce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to secure access to sensitive accounts and systems.      |



### Step 1: Event Log Review

I started by reviewing the event logs of the payroll incident. The logs showed that the event occurred on ```10/03/2023``` at ```8:29:57``` AM and was initiated by a user with administrator privileges (Legal\Administrator). The user’s IP address was ```152.207.255.255```, and the event source was tied to a service managing employee data (AdsmEmployeeService). This provided insight into when the breach happened and the role involved in the unauthorized action​.

### Step 2: Identifying Access Control Issues

Next, I cross-referenced the event log with the employee directory. I discovered two key access control issues:

***Shared administrator account:*** The incident was traced to a shared administrator account, making it difficult to identify the specific person responsible for the action.

***Excessive privileges:*** The administrator account had excessive privileges, allowing the user to modify payroll information without proper oversight. This weak control contributed to the payroll error​(Access control worksheet).

### Step 3: Mitigation Recommendations

To prevent future incidents like this, I recommended the following mitigations:

***Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):*** By limiting access based on job roles, employees would only have access to the resources necessary for their job. This would prevent unnecessary access to sensitive payroll systems by non-finance employees.

***Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):*** Introducing MFA for administrator-level accounts would add an extra layer of security, ensuring that even if an account is shared, access requires more than just a password.
