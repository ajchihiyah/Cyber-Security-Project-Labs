# Linux Encryption Decryption Lab: Breaking a Caesar Cipher and Using OpenSSL

## Scenario

In this lab, I faced a situation where all the files in my home directory were encrypted. To recover my data, I had to break a Caesar cipher and decrypt the files using Linux commands. This process involved exploring the directory, finding hidden files, solving the cipher, and finally decrypting the encrypted data file.

### Steps

***Task 1:*** Exploring the Home Directory and Reading a File

List files in the directory:
```bash
ls /home/analyst
```

Read the contents of README.txt:
```bash
cat README.txt
```

The file contained instructions advising me to look for a hidden file in the caesar subdirectory.

***Task 2:*** Finding a Hidden File and Decrypting the Caesar Cipher

Change directory to caesar:
```bash
cd caesar
```

List all files (including hidden ones):
```bash
ls -a
```
![Lab6step4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d52f1c3-b7f6-4ad0-8078-c0baddb8c176)


Read the hidden .leftShift3 file:
```bash
cat .leftShift3
```
Decrypt the Caesar cipher with a left shift of 3:
```bash
cat .leftShift3 | tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z"
```

This revealed the instructions for the next step.

***Task 3:*** Decrypting the Encrypted File

Use the provided openssl command to decrypt the file Q1.encrypted:
```bash
openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute
```

![Lab6step8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4a04b26-3f33-4c22-98c0-38b6a6af3d3e)


Verify the decrypted contents:
```bash
cat Q1.recovered
```

### Key Takeaways

Gained hands-on experience with Caesar ciphers and decryption.

Used the tr command in Linux to solve the Caesar cipher.

Used openssl to decrypt an encrypted file using AES-256-CBC encryption.

Reinforced the importance of command-line tools in data recovery and encryption.
