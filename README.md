# Ashley Jordan Chihiya Cybersecurity Lab Portfolio


## Professional Statements
As a dedicated and ambitious Master’s student in Cybersecurity at International University of Applied Sciences (IU) in Berlin, I am deeply passionate about securing digital infrastructures and combating evolving cyber threats. My academic journey, combined with hands-on experience and industry-recognized certifications such as the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, has equipped me with a robust foundation in threat analysis, risk management, and defensive strategies.

My interest in cybersecurity stems from a fascination with technology’s dual potential—to empower and to endanger. With the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, I am committed to developing proactive solutions that safeguard sensitive data and ensure organizational resilience. At IU, I have engaged in advanced coursework in network security, cryptography, ethical hacking, and digital forensics, while collaborating on research projects addressing real-world vulnerabilities.

Complementing my academic pursuits, the Google Cybersecurity Certification has honed my practical skills in SIEM tools, Python for automation, incident response, and cloud security. This certification has reinforced my ability to identify vulnerabilities, implement security frameworks, and adhere to compliance standards like NIST and ISO 27001.

Beyond technical expertise, I bring strong analytical thinking, problem-solving agility, and a collaborative mindset. I actively participate in cybersecurity forums and hackathons, staying abreast of emerging threats like AI-driven attacks and zero-day exploits. My goal is to contribute to a safer digital future—whether through threat intelligence, penetration testing, or security architecture—while continuously expanding my knowledge in this dynamic field.

I am eager to leverage my academic rigor, industry-aligned training, and unwavering curiosity to tackle cybersecurity challenges and drive innovation in the field. My aspiration is to become a leader in cybersecurity, bridging the gap between theoretical research and actionable defense strategies in an increasingly interconnected world.
