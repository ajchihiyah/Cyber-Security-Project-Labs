# Comparing tcpdump and Wireshark

**tcpdump** and **Wireshark** are two essential tools for capturing and analyzing network traffic. Both are open-source, but they serve different purposes depending on user needs.

**tcpdump** is a command-line tool that captures live traffic and outputs data in text format, ideal for real-time monitoring and scripting in remote or resource-constrained environments. **Wireshark** offers a graphical interface with advanced features for deep protocol analysis and visual traffic inspection, making it excellent for detailed packet dissection.

This lab will help you understand the differences and similarities between these tools by comparing their access requirements, interfaces, usage scenarios, and limitations. You'll also create a Venn diagram to visualize their distinct features.
