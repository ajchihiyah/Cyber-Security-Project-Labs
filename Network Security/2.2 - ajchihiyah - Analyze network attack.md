# Cybersecurity Incident Report: Analyze Network Attacks

## Scenario

You work as a security analyst for a travel agency that advertises sales and promotions on the company’s website. The employees of the company regularly access the company’s sales webpage to search for vacation packages their customers might like. 

One afternoon, you receive an automated alert from your monitoring system indicating a problem with the web server. You attempt to visit the company’s website, but you receive a connection timeout error message in your browser.

You use a packet sniffer to capture data packets in transit to and from the web server. You notice a large number of TCP SYN requests coming from an unfamiliar IP address. The web server appears to be overwhelmed by the volume of incoming traffic and is losing its ability to respond to the abnormally large number of SYN requests. You suspect the server is under attack by a malicious actor. 

You take the server offline temporarily so that the machine can recover and return to a normal operating status. You also configure the company’s firewall to block the IP address that was sending the abnormal number of SYN requests. You know that your IP blocking solution won’t last long, as an attacker can spoof other IP addresses to get around this block. You need to alert your manager about this problem quickly and discuss the next steps to stop this attacker and prevent this problem from happening again. You will need to be prepared to tell your boss about the type of attack you discovered and how it was affecting the web server and employees.

## Attack Analysis

### Type of Attack
The issue appears to be a **SYN flood attack**, a form of Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

### Explanation
A SYN flood attack occurs when a large number of TCP SYN requests are sent to the server, overwhelming it with connection attempts that aren’t completed. This prevents legitimate users from accessing the website, causing it to become unresponsive and resulting in connection timeouts.

### Log Analysis
In the logs, multiple SYN requests were observed from several IP addresses, such as:

- `203.0.113.0`
- `198.51.100.23`
- `198.51.100.14`

The server is responding with SYN-ACK packets, but the connections are not being completed. This indicates that the server is being flooded with incomplete connection requests, which is typical of a SYN flood attack.

### Event Summary
This event suggests that our server is under a SYN flood attack. The attacker is attempting to exhaust the server’s resources by flooding it with fake connection requests, making it impossible for legitimate users to connect.

### Next Steps

1. **Implement Rate Limiting**:  
   Apply basic rate limiting on incoming SYN packets to reduce the impact.

2. **Update Firewall Rules**:  
   Modify firewall rules to temporarily block IP addresses with abnormal traffic patterns.

3. **Consider Additional Defenses**:  
   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for enhanced protection.

## How the Attack is Causing the Website to Malfunction

When legitimate users try to access our website, they initiate a connection with the server using the TCP protocol. This process involves a three-step sequence called the **three-way handshake**:

### The Three-Way Handshake

1. **SYN (Synchronize)**: The user’s computer sends a request to the server with a SYN flag, asking to start a connection.
2. **SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge)**: The server responds with a SYN-ACK message to let the user know it’s ready to establish a connection.
3. **ACK (Acknowledge)**: The user’s computer sends back an ACK message, completing the handshake, and the connection is established.

### What Happens During a SYN Flood Attack

When an attacker sends a large number of SYN packets all at once:

1. The attacker sends many SYN requests to the server but doesn’t complete the handshake by sending back the final ACK message.
2. The server waits for these ACK messages and keeps the connections open, using up its resources like memory and processing power.
3. Because the server has to manage all these half-open connections, it becomes too busy and can’t respond to real users trying to connect.

**This makes the website slow or even completely inaccessible to legitimate visitors.**

### What the Logs Indicate and How That Affects the Server

- The logs show many SYN packets coming from different IP addresses without the final ACK messages. This means the server is flooded with incomplete connections.
- As a result, the server is overwhelmed, with its resources tied up managing these fake connections.
- This prevents the server from handling new requests from real users, causing the website to malfunction or show error messages.
