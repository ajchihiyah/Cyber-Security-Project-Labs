# Cybersecurity Incident Report: OS Hardening

## Scenario

You are a cybersecurity analyst for `yummyrecipesforme.com`, a website that sells recipes and cookbooks. A disgruntled baker has decided to publish the website’s best-selling recipes for the public to access for free.

### Incident Description

The baker executed a **brute force attack** to gain access to the web host. They repeatedly entered several known default passwords for the administrative account until they correctly guessed the right one. After obtaining the login credentials, they accessed the admin panel and altered the website’s source code. The baker embedded a JavaScript function in the source code that prompted visitors to download and run a file upon visiting the website. After executing the downloaded file, customers were redirected to a fake version of the website where the seller’s recipes were available for free.

### Customer Complaints

Several hours after the attack, multiple customers emailed `yummyrecipesforme.com`’s helpdesk. They reported that the website had prompted them to download a file to update their browsers. After running the file, the website address changed, and their personal computers began running more slowly.

### Incident Response

The website owner, unable to log in to the admin panel, contacted the website hosting provider. You, along with other cybersecurity analysts, were tasked with investigating this security event.

To address the incident, you created a sandbox environment to observe the suspicious website behavior:

1. **Setup**: You ran the network protocol analyzer `tcpdump` and navigated to `yummyrecipesforme.com`.
2. **Observation**: Upon loading the website, you were prompted to download an executable file to "update your browser."
3. **Execution**: You accepted the download and ran the file.
4. **Redirection**: After running the file, your browser redirected you to a different URL, `greatrecipesforme.com`, which was designed to look like the original site. The recipes your company sells were now posted for free on this new website.

The logs revealed the following process:

1. **DNS Resolution Request**: The browser requested a DNS resolution for `yummyrecipesforme.com`.
2. **DNS Response**: The DNS server replied with the correct IP address.
3. **HTTP Request**: The browser initiated an HTTP request for the webpage.
4. **Secondary DNS Request**: The browser requested another DNS resolution for `greatrecipesforme.com`.
5. **DNS Response**: The DNS server responded with the IP address for the new domain.
6. **HTTP Request**: The browser initiated an HTTP request to the new IP address.

### Analysis Confirmation

A senior analyst confirmed that the website had been compromised. Upon reviewing the website's source code, they discovered that a JavaScript code had been added, prompting website visitors to download an executable file. Analysis of the downloaded file found a script that redirected the visitors’ browsers from `yummyrecipesforme.com` to `greatrecipesforme.com`.

### Root Cause

The cybersecurity team reported that the web server was compromised by a brute force attack. The disgruntled baker was able to easily guess the password because the admin password was still set to the default. Additionally, there were no controls in place to prevent brute force attacks.

### Network Protocols Used

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Used for domain resolution of both `yummyrecipesforme.com` and `greatrecipesforme.com`.
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Used for the initial web request and subsequent navigation to the malicious site.
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Underlying transport layer protocol for the HTTP communication.

### Recommendations for Future Prevention

1. **Implement Strong Password Policies**:
   - Enforce strong, complex passwords for all administrative accounts.
   - Regularly update and change passwords to prevent unauthorized access.

2. **Utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Add an additional layer of security to ensure that only authorized users can access the admin panel.
