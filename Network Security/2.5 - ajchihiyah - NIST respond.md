# Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan

## Scenario

You are a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. Recently, the organization experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that compromised the internal network for two hours before it was resolved.

# Incident Report: DDoS Attack on Multimedia Company Network

## Incident Overview

**Incident Name**: ICMP Flood DDoS Attack on Multimedia Company Network    
**Reported By**: Virginie Bonhomme, Security Analyst  
**Summary**:  
Today, the multimedia company experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, which rendered internal network services unresponsive for two hours. The attack was executed using a flood of ICMP packets, overwhelming the network and preventing normal traffic from accessing network resources. The incident was resolved by the Incident Management Team (IMT) through immediate mitigation measures.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Analysis

This report follows the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to document the incident and provide recommendations for enhancing the organization’s security posture.

### 1. Identify

**Objective**: Identify and understand the risks to organizational systems, assets, and data.

**Findings**:
- **Asset Management**: The firewall lacked proper configuration, making it a vulnerable asset.
- **Risk Assessment**: There were no pre-defined limits or rules for ICMP traffic, exposing the network to potential DDoS attacks.
- **Vulnerability Identification**: The lack of advanced monitoring and traffic filtering mechanisms allowed the attack to go undetected for a period of time.

**Recommendations**:
- Conduct regular audits of network configurations and asset inventories.
- Perform risk assessments to identify and prioritize potential vulnerabilities.
- Implement a robust vulnerability management program to proactively identify and address security gaps.

### 2. Protect

**Objective**: Implement appropriate safeguards to ensure the protection of critical services.

**Actions Taken**:
- **Firewall Rule Update**: A new rule was implemented to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets, reducing the risk of similar attacks.
- **Source IP Verification**: Source IP address verification was enabled on the firewall to detect and block spoofed IP addresses in incoming ICMP packets.

**Additional Recommendations**:
- **Access Control**: Enforce stricter access controls and ensure that only authorized personnel have the ability to modify firewall configurations.
- **Data Security**: Encrypt sensitive data and implement secure protocols for network communication.
- **Awareness Training**: Conduct security awareness training for all employees to recognize and respond to potential security threats.

### 3. Detect

**Objective**: Develop and implement appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of cybersecurity events.

**Actions Taken**:
- **Network Monitoring Software**: Deployed enhanced network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns.
- **IDS/IPS Deployment**: Integrated an Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) to filter out ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics.

**Recommendations**:
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Establish a Security Operations Center (SOC) for 24/7 monitoring of network traffic and security events.
- **Logging and Alerting**: Configure logging and alerting systems to ensure that security personnel are notified of potential incidents immediately.

### 4. Respond

**Objective**: Develop and implement appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity event.

**Actions Taken**:
- **Incident Response**: The Incident Management Team (IMT) blocked incoming ICMP packets, took non-critical services offline, and restored critical network services.
- **Post-Incident Analysis**: The cybersecurity team conducted a thorough investigation and identified the root cause of the attack.

**Recommendations**:
- **Incident Response Plan (IRP)**: Develop a comprehensive Incident Response Plan outlining procedures for handling DDoS attacks and other security incidents.
- **Communication Plan**: Establish a communication plan for notifying stakeholders and customers during security events.
- **Post-Incident Review**: Conduct post-incident reviews to analyze the effectiveness of the response and identify areas for improvement.

### 5. Recover

**Objective**: Develop and implement appropriate activities to maintain resilience and restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event.

**Actions Taken**:
- **Service Restoration**: All critical network services were restored after blocking the ICMP traffic and configuring the firewall rules.
- **System Hardening**: Additional security measures were implemented to strengthen the network against future attacks.

**Recommendations**:
- **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)**: Develop and test a Business Continuity Plan to ensure rapid recovery from disruptions.
- **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)**: Create and maintain a Disaster Recovery Plan to restore affected systems and data in case of severe incidents.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Regularly back up critical data and test recovery procedures to ensure data integrity and availability.

## Conclusion

The DDoS attack on the multimedia company’s network highlighted several vulnerabilities in the current security posture. By following the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the organization has taken significant steps to address these weaknesses and improve its defenses against future attacks.

The cybersecurity team will continue to monitor the network and implement additional security measures as needed. Regular reviews of security policies, continuous monitoring, and employee training are crucial to maintaining a robust security posture.
