# Security Risk Assessment

## Scenario

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. Recently, the organization experienced a major data breach, compromising the safety of customersâ€™ personal information, including names and addresses. To prevent future attacks and breaches, the organization aims to implement robust network hardening practices. After evaluating the network infrastructure, you have identified four critical vulnerabilities:

1. **Password Sharing Among Employees**:  
   Employees are sharing passwords, which can lead to unauthorized access and make it difficult to track user activities.

2. **Default Admin Password for Database**:  
   The admin password for the database is still set to the default, making it susceptible to brute force and dictionary attacks.

3. **Lack of Firewall Rules**:  
   Firewalls do not have rules configured to filter incoming and outgoing network traffic, exposing the network to unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration.

4. **No Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**:  
   The absence of MFA increases the risk of unauthorized access, as there is no additional layer of security beyond the username and password.

If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of another data breach or other security incidents in the future.

## Security Risk Assessment

### 1. Password Sharing Among Employees

**Risk**:  
Sharing passwords among employees increases the likelihood of unauthorized access and makes it challenging to determine who is responsible for specific actions.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement a strict password policy that prohibits sharing passwords.
- Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for each employee.
- Educate employees on the importance of keeping their credentials secure.

### 2. Default Admin Password for Database

**Risk**:  
Using a default admin password makes the database highly vulnerable to attacks, such as brute force and dictionary attacks.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Change the default admin password immediately to a strong, unique password.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit administrative privileges to essential personnel only.
- Regularly update and rotate passwords for critical accounts.

### 3. Lack of Firewall Rules

**Risk**:  
Without firewall rules, the network is exposed to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential malware infections.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Configure firewall rules to filter both inbound and outbound traffic based on IP address, port, and protocol.
- Regularly review and update firewall rules to adapt to evolving security requirements.

### 4. No Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

**Risk**:  
The absence of MFA increases the risk of unauthorized access, especially in the case of compromised or weak passwords.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement MFA for all employee accounts, especially those with administrative access.
- Use a combination of factors, such as a password and a time-based one-time password (TOTP) or biometric verification.
- Regularly review and enforce MFA policies for all accounts.

## Recommendations for Network Hardening

1. **Implement Strong Password Policies**:
   - Enforce the use of complex, unique passwords.
   - Implement mandatory password changes at regular intervals.
   - Prohibit password reuse and sharing.

2. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Perform regular security assessments and penetration tests to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
   - Conduct periodic reviews of user access rights and firewall rules.

3. **Security Awareness Training**:
   - Provide ongoing training for employees on security best practices, such as recognizing phishing attempts and safeguarding credentials.

4. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access and data leaks.

By implementing these network hardening practices and addressing the identified vulnerabilities, the organization can significantly reduce the risk of future data breaches and strengthen its overall security posture.
