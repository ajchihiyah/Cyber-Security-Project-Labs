# Cybersecurity Incident Report: Analyze Network Layer Communication

## Scenario

You are a cybersecurity analyst working at a company that specializes in providing IT consultant services. Several customers contacted your company to report that they were not able to access the company website www.yummyrecipesforme.com, and saw the error “destination port unreachable” after waiting for the page to load. 

You are tasked with analyzing the situation and determining which network protocol was affected during this incident. To start, you visit the website and you also receive the error “destination port unreachable.” Next, you load your network analyzer tool, tcpdump, and load the webpage again. This time, you receive a lot of packets in your network analyzer. The analyzer shows that when you send UDP packets and receive an ICMP response returned to your host, the results contain an error message: “udp port 53 unreachable.”

## DNS and ICMP Log Analysis

In the DNS and ICMP log, the following information was found:

### Initial Outgoing Request
The first two lines of the log file show the initial outgoing request from your computer to the DNS server, asking for the IP address of `yummyrecipesforme.com`. This request is sent in a UDP packet.

### Timestamps
Timestamps indicate when the event occurred. In the log, the first sequence of numbers represents the timestamp. For example: `13:24:32.192571` indicates the time `1:24 p.m., 32.192571 seconds`.

### Source and Destination IP Addresses
The source and destination IP addresses are displayed next. In the error log, this information appears as: 


- **Source IP Address**: The IP address on the left side of the greater than (`>`) symbol is the source, which is your computer’s IP address (`192.51.100.15`).
- **Destination IP Address**: The IP address on the right side is the destination, which is the DNS server’s IP address (`203.0.113.2.domain`).

### ICMP Error Message
The second and third lines of the log show the response to your initial ICMP request packet. The line starting with `ICMP 203.0.113.2` indicates the beginning of the error message, showing that the ICMP packet could not be delivered to the DNS server's port.

### Protocol and Port Information
Next, the log displays the protocol and port number used to handle communications, along with the destination port. In the error log, this appears as:


- **Protocol**: UDP was used to request a domain name resolution.
- **Port**: Port 53 was targeted, which aligns with the `.domain` extension in `203.0.113.2.domain` and is the well-known port for DNS services.

The word “unreachable” indicates that the message did not go through to the DNS server. Your browser could not obtain the IP address for `yummyrecipesforme.com` because no service was listening on the receiving DNS port, as indicated by the ICMP error message “udp port 53 unreachable.”

### Subsequent Attempts
The remaining lines in the log show that ICMP packets were sent two more times, but each attempt resulted in the same delivery error.


## Network Analysis Findings

### Client DNS Query Attempts
The UDP protocol analysis reveals that the client device with IP address `192.51.100.15` attempted to resolve the domain `yummyrecipesforme.com` using DNS queries sent to the DNS server at `203.0.113.2` on UDP port 53. The repeated attempts indicate that the client was unable to receive a valid DNS response.

### ICMP Error Message Analysis
Based on the network analysis results, the ICMP echo reply returned the error message: `"UDP port 53 unreachable."` This message indicates that the DNS server at `203.0.113.2` was either not running a DNS service or was misconfigured and unable to handle DNS queries on port 53.

### Port Information
- **Port Noted in the Error Message**:  
  UDP port 53 is used for DNS (Domain Name System) queries and responses. It is essential for resolving domain names to IP addresses.

### Most Likely Issue
The most likely issue is that the DNS service on the server at `203.0.113.2` is not operational or properly configured. This could be due to one of the following reasons:

- The DNS service is down.
- A firewall is blocking the port.
- The DNS server software is not listening on the correct port.

As a result, the server responded with ICMP error messages indicating that the DNS service was unreachable on port 53.


## Incident Report

### Time Incident Occurred
The incident began at `13:24:32` and continued with periodic attempts until at least `13:28:50`, indicating a repeated issue over approximately four minutes.

### How the IT Team Became Aware of the Incident
The IT team was alerted through ICMP error messages received from the DNS server (`203.0.113.2`). These messages indicated that the DNS server was unreachable on UDP port 53, which is crucial for DNS queries.

### Actions Taken by the IT Department to Investigate the Incident

1. **Review of TCPDump Logs**:  
   The team analyzed the logs showing repeated DNS queries from the client (`192.51.100.15`) attempting to resolve the domain `yummyrecipesforme.com`.

2. **Identification of ICMP Messages**:  
   The team noticed several "port unreachable" ICMP responses from the DNS server, indicating a problem with the DNS service on UDP port 53.

3. **DNS Server Check**:  
   The team likely checked the availability and configuration of the DNS server at `203.0.113.2` to verify whether it was active and correctly configured.

### Key Findings of the IT Department's Investigation

- **Affected Port**:  
  UDP port 53 on the DNS server (`203.0.113.2`).

- **Client Details**:  
  The client at IP address `192.51.100.15` repeatedly attempted to query the DNS server.

- **Server Response**:  
  The DNS server responded with ICMP "port unreachable" messages, implying that the DNS service was either down or not listening on port 53.

### Likely Cause of the Incident
The likely cause of the incident is that the DNS server at `203.0.113.2` was either misconfigured or the DNS service was not running, resulting in the server being unable to handle DNS queries on port 53. This misconfiguration or service outage led to the repeated ICMP error messages seen in the logs.
