# File and Directory Permissions Lab

In this lab, I focused on securing a directory and its contents by exploring and adjusting file and directory permissions. Managing permissions is crucial for system security to ensure that only authorized users can access, modify, or execute files. Below, I’ve documented my process, including the commands I used, explanations, and my key takeaways.

---

## Project Description

The main goals of this lab were:
- Explore the contents of the `projects` directory to identify potential permission vulnerabilities.
- Modify file and directory permissions to remove unauthorized access.
- Understand how to interpret the 10-character permission string with `ls -la`.
- Practice using `chmod` to update permissions based on the principle of least privilege.

# Task 1: Checking File and Directory Details

First, I needed to explore the `projects` directory to understand the current permissions. This helped me identify any hidden files and misconfigurations.

**Steps:**

1. **Navigate to the `projects` directory:**
```bash
cd projects
```

2. **Listing Contents and Permissions of the `projects` Directory**
```bash
 ls -l
```

3. **Check for hidden files**
```bash
 ls -la
```

# Understanding the 10-Character Permission String

When using the `ls -l` command to list files and directories, you’ll encounter a 10-character string representing the type and permissions. Here's the breakdown:

## Structure of the Permission String

1. **First Character:** Type of item:
   - `-` : File  
   - `d` : Directory

2. **Next Three Characters:** Permissions for the **owner (user)**.

3. **Next Three Characters:** Permissions for the **group**.

4. **Last Three Characters:** Permissions for **others (everyone else)**.

---

### Example

```plaintext
-rw-r--r--
```
**Owner (user): `rw-`**  
The owner can **read** (`r`) and **write** (`w`), but not **execute** (`-`).

**Group: `r--`** 
The group can only **read** (`r`).

**Others (everyone else): `r--`** 
Others can only **read** (`r`).

# Task 2: Changing File Permissions

I identified files with incorrect permissions and adjusted them to enhance security.

**Steps** 

1. Check for Files with Write Permissions for Others
```bash
ls -l
```
2. Remove Write Permissions for Others

To revoke write permissions for others, I used:
```bash
chmod o-w project_k.txt
```
Check if Permission was updated
```bash
ls -l
```
![Lab3step3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95136aee-cbc8-404b-8483-ec2c806968b5)

3. Restrict access to group in project_m.txt:
```bash
chmod g-r project_m.txt
```
Check if Permission was updated
```bash
ls -l
```
![Lab3step4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa6d3389-b6ff-4562-8849-b33d6d6313e8)

This command removed read access from the group for `project_m.txt`. Only the owner should be able to read and write to it.

# Task 3: Changing Permissions on a Hidden File

I found a hidden file named ```.project_x.txt``` and needed to secure it further by restricting write access.

**Steps**

1. Check the permissions of the hidden file:
```bash
ls -la
```
2. Modify permissions to allow only read access:
```bash
chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt
```
Check if Permission was updated
```bash
ls -la
```
![Lab3step5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c25b4b98-b39c-4ad6-936a-d63a1629f485)

This command ensured that the user and group could only read the file but not write to it.

# Task 4: Changing Directory Permissions

Next, I focused on the drafts directory to ensure only the researcher2 user could access it.

**Steps**

1. Check the permissions of the drafts directory:
```bash
ls -l
```
2. Remove execute permission from the group:
```bash
chmod g-x drafts
```
Check if Permission was updated
```bash
ls -l
```
![Lab3step6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c08312d-586a-4b89-a40f-01513578a2a9)

By removing the group’s execute permission, I ensured only the researcher2 user could access the directory.

# Key Takeawys

The chmod command is essential for managing file and directory permissions. Here’s a quick summary of how I used it:

u: User (owner) permissions

g: Group permissions

o: Other permissions

+: Add permission

-: Remove permission


# Summary

This lab gave me valuable hands-on experience with managing file and directory permissions. I learned how to:

Navigate directories and list files using ls.

View hidden files and interpret the 10-character permission string with ls -la.

Use chmod to modify permissions based on the principle of least privilege.

Secure sensitive files by restricting unauthorized access.

Ensure only authorized users can access specific directories.

Proper permission management is critical for system security. These skills will help me secure files and systems effectively, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
