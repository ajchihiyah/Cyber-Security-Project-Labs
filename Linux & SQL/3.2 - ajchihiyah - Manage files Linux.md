# Linux Lab Report: Log and User Data Analysis

## Objective:
In this lab, I performed a series of tasks related to searching and filtering through log files and user data in a Linux environment. The lab required me to obtain specific information from server logs and user data files using commands like `grep`, `ls`, and piping for efficient filtering and reporting.

## Task 1: Search for Error Messages in a Log File

### Objective:
Identify error messages from a server log file.

### Steps:
- **Navigating to the logs directory:**

  I used the `cd` command to navigate to the `/home/analyst/logs` directory.

  - **Filtering for Error Messages**

    I utilized the `grep` command to search for all occurrences of the text string `"error"` in the `server_logs.txt` file. The `grep` command helped to output only the lines in the log file that contained the word `"error"`.

## Task 2: Find Files Containing Specific Strings

**Objective:** Search for user data files that contain specific strings in their filenames.

### Steps:

- **Navigating to the users directory:**

  I used `cd` to navigate to the `/home/analyst/reports/users` directory.
  
- **Finding Files Containing "Q1" in Their Names**

  By piping the output of the `ls` command to `grep`, I filtered the list of files to display only those containing `"Q1"` in their   filenames.

```
ls | grep "Q1"
```

- **Listing Files That Contain "access" in Their Names**

  I repeated the process, this time using `grep` to find files that contain the word `"access"` in their filenames.

```bash
ls | grep "access"
```

## Task 3: Search More File Contents

**Objective:** Search within specific user data files for information about users added and deleted from the system.

### Steps:

- **Displaying the files in the users directory:**
  I first listed the contents of the `/home/analyst/reports/users` directory to identify the available user data files.

```bash
ls
```

- **Searching for the user "jhill" in the deleted users file:**

  I used the `grep` command to search for the username `"jhill"` in the `Q2_deleted_users.txt` file. This allowed me to determine if this user was among those deleted.

```bash
grep "jhill" Q2_deleted_users.txt
```

## Conclusion 
Through this lab, I gained hands-on experience with using essential Linux commands like `grep`, `ls`, and piping (`|`) to search log files and user data efficiently. I was able to filter and retrieve specific error messages, identify files containing particular strings, and search for detailed information within user data files. This lab reinforced my ability to handle common tasks in system administration using the command line.
