# SQL Lab: Investigating Employee Devices and Login Activity

In this lab, we work with the machines and log_in_attempts tables to retrieve relevant data, identifying employee devices that require updates and detecting unusual login patterns.

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to practice SQL queries to:

Identify devices needing updates by retrieving information on email clients, operating systems, and patch dates.

Detect unusual login activity by analyzing login locations and times for suspicious behavior.
This lab focuses on using SELECT and ORDER BY commands to extract, sort, and analyze data efficiently.

# Task 1: Retrieve Employee Device Data

I need to gather information on employee devices, focusing on operating systems, patch dates, and email clients.

***Steps***

1. Select All Device Data
```sql
SELECT *
FROM machines;
```

2. Focus on Email Client
```sql
SELECT device_id, email_client
FROM machines;
```

***Task Query:*** What is the email client returned in the third row from the machines table?

***Answer:*** The email client returned in the third row is Email Client 2.

3. Retrieve Operating System and Patch Date
```sql
SELECT device_id, operating_system, OS_patch_date
FROM machines;
```

***Task Query:*** Retrieve the patch date of the first entry from the machines table.

***Answer:*** The patch date of the first entry is 2021-09-01.


# Task 2: Investigate Login Activity

Now, letâ€™s investigate login attempts to detect any unusual activity, including checking for logins from unexpected locations and outside working hours.

***Steps***

1. Check Login Locations
```sql
SELECT event_id, country
FROM log_in_attempts;
```

![Lab4step4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25bb0368-4363-4ff5-a39c-c2829bdfd533)


***Task Query:*** Were any login attempts made from Australia?

***Answer:*** No login attempts were made from Australia.

2. Check Login Outside Working Hours
```sql
SELECT username, login_date, login_time
FROM log_in_attempts;
```

![Lab4Step5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/241f5f20-9225-4ecf-b3c2-9493e29a296a)


***Task Query:*** What is the username returned in the fifth row of the log_in_attempts table?

***Answer:*** The username returned in the fifth row is jrafael.

3. Retrieve All Login Data
```sql
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts;
```

# Task 3: Order Login Attempts Data

We will now organize the login attempts by date and time using the ORDER BY keyword.

***Step***

1. Order by Login Date
```sql
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
ORDER BY login_date;
```
![Lab4Step8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24e2dc89-198e-49f1-a563-336ce1242071)


***Task Query:*** What is the username and login date of the first record returned from the log_in_attempts table when ordered by login date?

***Answer:*** The first record returned contains a username of ivelasco and a login date of 2022-05-08.

2. Order by Login Date and Time
```sql
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
ORDER BY login_date, login_time;
```

![Lab4step9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee7e4c14-5eb9-443d-9eca-d5c74f6bc4d4)


***Task Query:*** What is the username and login time of the first record returned from the log_in_attempts table when ordered by login date and time?

***Answer:*** The first record returned contains a username of bsand and a login time of 00:19:11.

# Conclusion

This SQL lab demonstrates how to:

Extract and filter device data to identify which devices require updates.
Investigate login attempts to detect any unusual or suspicious activity.
Utilize the ORDER BY clause to sort data by dates and times, helping to uncover patterns and anomalies efficiently.
These skills are essential for managing IT infrastructure and ensuring security through data analysis.
